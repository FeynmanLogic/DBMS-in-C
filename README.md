# Basic C DBMS Application

This simple Database Management System (DBMS) application in C provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. The program operates on a text file ("database.txt") to store and manage entries, each consisting of an ID, name, and college. The user is presented with a menu to choose operations such as creating a new entry, reading the entire database, updating an entry (yet to be implemented), and deleting an entry (yet to be implemented). The application ensures the integrity of the database by checking for duplicate IDs before adding new entries.

## Usage

To use the application, compile the "main.c" file and run the executable. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the DBMS.

```bash
# Compile the code
gcc main.c -o dbms

# Run the application
./dbms
